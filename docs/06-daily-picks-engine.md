# 06 – Daily Picks Engine

Orchestrates the end-to-end flow: fetch today's data → run models → output picks → store results.

---

## Pipeline Overview

- ✅ 8:00 AM   Fetch schedule + probable pitchers
- ✅ 8:05 AM   Fetch team stats (rolling, season-level) *(basic fetch present, DB merge TBD)*
- ✅ 11:00 AM   Fetch odds (opening lines)
- ✅ 11:05 AM   Fetch weather forecasts
- ✅ 11:10 AM   Build feature matrix for today's games
- ✅ 11:15 AM   Run all 3 models → raw predictions
- ✅ 11:20 AM   Apply filters (min edge, min confidence)
- ✅ 11:25 AM   Format picks, store in DB, publish to API *(CSV backup; SQL insert not yet)*
- ✅ 4:00 PM   Re-fetch odds (updated lines), re-run models
- ✅ 4:15 PM   Update picks if significant line movement
- ✅ 11:00 PM   Fetch final scores
- ✅ 11:05 PM   Settle picks (win/loss/push), update metrics
```
